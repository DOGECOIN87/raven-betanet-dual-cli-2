# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for completing two CLI tools for the Raven Betanet 1.1 bounty deliverables: a spec-compliance linter (`raven-linter`) and a Chrome uTLS template generator (`chrome-utls-gen`). The project must implement all 11 compliance checks from ยง11 of the Betanet 1.1 spec, generate SBOMs in multiple formats, create deterministic Chrome TLS ClientHello templates, and provide comprehensive CI/CD integration.

### Requirement 4: Security and Metadata Checks (Checks 9-11)

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the linter to validate security flags, version information, and license compliance, so that I can ensure the binary meets regulatory and security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN check 9 executes THEN the system SHALL validate security flag settings (ASLR, DEP, etc.)
2. WHEN check 10 executes THEN the system SHALL extract and validate version information
3. WHEN check 11 executes THEN the system SHALL verify license compliance information
4. WHEN security flags are missing THEN the system SHALL report specific missing flags
5. WHEN version information is incomplete THEN the system SHALL report missing version components

### Requirement 5: SBOM Generation

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the linter to generate Software Bill of Materials in industry-standard formats, so that I can integrate with supply chain security tools and meet compliance requirements.

2. WHEN SBOM generation is requested THEN the system SHALL support SPDX 2.3 JSON format
3. WHEN generating SBOM THEN the system SHALL include all detected components and dependencies
4. WHEN generating SBOM THEN the system SHALL validate output against official schemas
5. WHEN SBOM generation fails THEN the system SHALL continue with compliance checks and warn about SBOM failure
6. WHEN SBOM is generated THEN the system SHALL include metadata about the tool, target binary, and generation timestamp

### Requirement 6: Chrome uTLS Template Generator CLI (chrome-utls-gen)

**User Story:** As a network security researcher, I want a CLI tool that generates deterministic TLS ClientHello templates identical to Chrome Stable versions, so that I can perform accurate TLS fingerprinting and testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `chrome-utls-gen generate` THEN the system SHALL create a deterministic ClientHello blob identical to Chrome Stable (N or N-2)
2. WHEN I run `chrome-utls-gen ja3-test <target>` THEN the system SHALL connect to the target and extract JA3 fingerprint
3. WHEN I run `chrome-utls-gen update` THEN the system SHALL fetch latest Chrome versions and regenerate templates
4. WHEN generating ClientHello THEN the system SHALL produce identical bytes to real Chrome connections
5. WHEN testing JA3 THEN the system SHALL verify exact match to expected Chrome fingerprint values
6. WHEN updating templates THEN the system SHALL use official Chromium release API

### Requirement 7: Chrome Version Management

**User Story:** As a security tester, I want the tool to automatically manage Chrome Stable (N) and Stable (N-2) versions, so that I can test against current and previous stable releases without manual version tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria
